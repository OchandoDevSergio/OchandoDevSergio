# Hello! :wave:
I have a diverse academic background with a Bachelor's degree in Political Science and Philosophy, and a Master's degree in Philosophy. Despite my academic focus, I have transitioned into the field of software development, where I specialize in both backend and frontend technologies.

For the past two years, I have been working in the IT sector, both as a freelancer and as an employee for companies. During this time, I have gained solid experience in technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, PHP, React, Angular, NodeJS, Symfony, and FastAPI. My work includes building scalable web applications, developing REST APIs, and ensuring software quality through testing.

I am well-versed in Agile methodologies, particularly SCRUM, and have frequently collaborated directly with clients, translating their needs into efficient, innovative solutions. I take pride in bridging the gap between technical complexity and business requirements, ensuring that projects not only meet but exceed expectations.

With a passion for learning and adopting new technologies, I enjoy solving complex problems through code and constantly improving my skills.
